abstract = {Plants sustain human life. Understanding geographic patterns of the diversity of species used by people is thus essential for the sustainable management of plant resources. Here, we investigate the global distribution of 35,687 utilized plant species spanning 10 use categories (e.g., food, medicine, material). Our findings indicate general concordance between utilized and total plant diversity, supporting the potential for simultaneously conserving species diversity and its contributions to people. Although Indigenous lands across Mesoamerica, the Horn of Africa, and Southern Asia harbor a disproportionate diversity of utilized plants, the incidence of protected areas is negatively correlated with utilized species richness. Finding mechanisms to preserve areas containing concentrations of utilized plants and traditional knowledge must become a priority for the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. A diverse array of plants provides the base materials for human sustenance and livelihoods. Although some of these plant species have become ubiquitous, others are endemic to certain locations, where they have specific cultural uses. Pironon et al. studied where plants used by people occur and how their hotspots of diversity and endemism overlap with broader patterns of plant diversity and the locations of protected areas. They found that utilized species diversity is correlated with overall plant diversity, suggesting that prioritizing biodiversity hotspots for conservation could protect many of these species. However, current protected areas are inadequate for conserving these species and their associated biocultural diversity. —Bianca Lopez Plants used by people are insufficiently protected globally, suggesting a need to preserve biocultural diversity hotspots.}}
